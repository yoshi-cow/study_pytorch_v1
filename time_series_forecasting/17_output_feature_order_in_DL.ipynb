Here's a breakdown of the key points that determin the order of output features in a LSTM:\n","1. **Output Layer Configuration:** The most direct way that the output feature order is defined is by the structures of the output layer. This layer is typically a fully connected(linear) layer in many applications, including regression and classification tasks. The output of this layer is explicitly connected to the neurons of the preceding layer (the last hidden state of the LSTM), and each output neuron corresponds to a specific output feature.\n","2. **Consistency(一貫性) with Input Features**: In many cases, especially in applications involving time series or sequence prediction where each input and output feature corresponds to a specific variable (like stock prices for different companies), the output order is aligned with the input feature order. This alignment is not automatically managed by the LSTM but rather by how the data is prepared and how the network is intended to interpret these features.\n","3. **Model Definition**: When defining the model, the programmer specifies the number of outputs in the final layer (**output_dim** in your PyTorch model), and this typically corresponds to the number of features or varialbes being predicted. The logical order of these output is usually maintained throughout the model unless specifically altered through operations like sorting or selecting with in the model.\n","4. **Data Preparation**: The way data is fed into the LSTM can affect how output features are interpreted. If data preprocessing involves arranging or sorting features in a particular order, this order should be maintained consistently through training and prediction phases to ensure that each output can be correctly associated with its respective feature.\n","\n","\n","\n","In summary, in a LSTM model, the order of the output features is generally defined by the structure of the output layer and is consistent(と一致する) with the order of the input features, unless explicitly re-arranged. In your specific case, since the features are [\"amz\", \"apple\", \"msn\", \"google\", \"amz_pct\", \"apple_pct\", \"msn_pct\", \"google_pct\"] and outputs are directly predicting the weights or influences of the first four stocks, the outputs [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1] directly correspond in order to [\"amz\", \"apple\", \"msn\", \"google\"]."],"metadata":{"id":"KwjTS43pVxk7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# How output order decided?\n","In the realm of deep learing, the relationship between the order of input features and the order of output features is largely dependent on the specific task and architecture of the model being used. Here's a general breakdown of <u>how input feature order can influence output order</u> in various scenarios:\n","1. **Standard Feedforward Networks**: For standard feedforward networks, including most fully connected (dense) layers, the order of input features does not necessarily determine the order of output features. Each neuron in a layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer, and each connection has its own weight. The outpu of each neuron is a function of the weighted sum of all inputs, processed through an activation function. Thus, <u>there isn't direct positional correspondence between specific input and output features</u>.\n","2. **Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs)**: In CNNs, used primarily for spatial data like images, the output feature maps (channels) do not directly correspond to specific input feature maps. Instead, each output feature map is a result of convolving a filter over all input channels. <u>The relationship between input and output order in CNNs is more about layers and depth (i.e., which layer produces which feature map)</u> rather than a direct mapping of input feature to output feature.\n","3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs**: For RNNs and LSTMs, which are often used for sequencial data (e.g., time series or text), <u>the outputs at each timestep are usually related to the input at that timestep (and the hidden states from previous timesteps)</u>. However, the order of output features per timestep usually corresponds to the arrangement of neurons in the output layer, not to individual input feature per se.\n","4. **Transformers**: In transformer models, especially those used in NLP, the outputs (like those in the final layer of a BERT model) correspond positionally to the inputs due to the nature of the self-attention mechanism.  <u>Each position in the output sequence of embeddings direclty relates to the corresponding position in the input sequence</u>, although each output embedding is influenced by all input embeddings due to attention.\n","5. **Specific Tasks like Regression or Multi-Label Classification**: In tasks where a network predicts multiple values simultaneously - like predicting several types of properties from input data (e.g., predicting both the price and the category of houses based on their features) - the order of outputs generally corresponds to how the output layer is organized and defined, which might mirror the order of relevance or logical setup by the designer.\n","\n","\n","**Conclusion**\n","\n","The correspondence between the order of input features and the order of output featuress is mostly a function of network architecture, layer functions ,and specific task requirements. It is not a fixed rule in deep learning but rather depends on how the network is designed to interpret and transform the inputs into outputs. For many applications, especially those involving tabular data or specific structured outputs, maintaining a consistent and logical order between inputs and outputs is neccesary for interpretation and practical application of the model's predictions.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TN1Na3kKefqv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Does output feature's order change?\n","Q: In above my code, If We change input order like [\"amz\", \"amz_pct\", \"apple\", \"apple_pct\",  \"msn\", \"msn_pct\", \"google\", \"google_pct\"], Does output feature's order change?\n","\n","A: In the scenario you've described where you change the order of the input features in your dataset, the interpretation of how it impacts the order of the output features in your LSTM model depends on a few key aspects:\n","\n","1. **Model Architecture**: The LSTM architecture you're using involves predicting a specific set of outputs (weights for \"amz\", \"apple\", \"msn\", and \"google\") based on the input features. The architecure (LSTM layers, followed by a linear layer, and a softmax activation) processes sequential and time-series data but doesn't inherently linkd specific input feature positions to specific output positions because of the nature of the LSTM processing and the fully connected output layer.\n","2. **Output Layer**: In your model, the output layer is defined as a linear layer that transforms the last hidden state of the LSTM into four outputs (one for each stock). This transformation uses weights and biases that aggregate information across all inputs as processed by the LSTM. The LSTM and the fully connected layer do not have a direct positional dependency on the input features in terms of mapping directly to output features. They are more about aggregating and interpreting the entier input sequence into a set of outputs.\n","3. **Impact of Changing Input Order**:\n","    * **Internal Model Dynamics**: Changing the order of input features (e.g., pairing each stock's price immediately with its percentage change) could potentially change how the LSTM processes information temporally and might affect how effectively it learns dependencies between prices and their changes. It might capture the relationships between prices and their changes more directly or differentky.\n","    * **Output Feature Order**: The order of the outpu features themselves (as designated in your model's final layer) will not change simply because you changed the input order. The outputs will still correspond to the stocks as \"amz\", \"apple\", \"msn\", and \"google\" in that order, because that is how the output layer is structured to produce results.\n","4. **Interpretaion**: While the internal processing and perhaps the performance of the model could be affected by reordering the inputs (potentially improving or degrading based on how well the model can learn from the new input structure), the output order itself is fixed by how you define what each output neuron represents. If you haven't changed the output layer configuration and the way you interpret each output, they still represent the weights for \"amz\", \"apple\", \"msn\", and \"google\" in the same order as initially defined.\n","\n","\n","\n","In conclusion, changing the order of the input features might affect how the model learns and processes information, possibly affecting model performance or sensitivity, but it does not change the designated order of the output features. These are determined by the structure of the network's output layer and how you've programmed the model to interpret these outputs.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"N1XnI4h0kDBW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q: So, under this code, We don't have to modify code when we change order of input features like [\"amz\", \"amz_pct\", \"apple\", \"apple_pct\",  \"msn\", \"msn_pct\", \"google\", \"google_pct\"]. Is that right?\n","\n","\n","A: Yes, that's correct to an extent. In the cotext of your specific LSTM model, changing the order of input features to the format [\"amz\", \"amz_pct\", \"apple\", \"apple_pct\", \"msn\", \"msn_pct\", \"google\", \"google_pct\"] doesn't require changes to the structure of the neural network itself (e.g., layers, connections, output dimensions). The model's output layer, which predicts the weights for \"amz\", \"apple\", \"msn\", and \"google\" based on the learned features from the LSTM, will still function as intended because the interpretation of the outputs is dictated by how the output layer is configured, not directly by the input feature order.\n","\n","\n","However, while the core code for the neural network structure might not need modification, there are considerations and potential adjustments you may need to make elsewhere in your pipeline:\n","1. **Feature Preparation**: When you change the order of inputs, you shoul ensure that any preprocessing steps applied to the data before it enters the model are adjusted accordingly. This includes any normalization, scaling, or transformations that are dependent on the order of the features.\n","2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Any changes in the input feature order might affect how the model learns the relationships between the features. It could influence model training dynamics and ultimately the performance. It would be important to retain the model with the new input configuration to allow it to adapt to how the data is now presented.\n","3. **Data Loading**: Ensure that the dataset preparation, especially how sequences are sliced and diced in your custom dataset class (**FinancialDataset**), aligns with the new feature order. This step is crucial because LSTM models depend heavily on the sequence in which data is presented.\n","4. **interpretability and Consistency**: If the model is part of a larger system or if results are interpreted downstream by other components or stakeholders, ensure that everyone understands the new input configuration and how it might affect interpretations or operations.\n","\n","\n","In summary, While you don't need to modify LSTM's architecture or the output layer, careful attention should be paid to preprocessing, data handling, and potentially retraining the model to ensure it performs optimally with the new input feature order. This will help the model adapt appropriately to the changes and maintain or even improve its predictive performance."],"metadata":{"id":"wW_KEoG7qE5p"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"3qDP5L6iUnWN"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
