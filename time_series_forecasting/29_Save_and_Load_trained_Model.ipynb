PyTorch offers two main ways to save a model: saving the entire model using **torch.save()** or saving just the model state dictionary. Saving the state dictionary is the recommended way, asi it allows for more flexibility if you need to change the model architecture later but still want to use the pretrained weights.\n","\n","\n","Here's how to save the model state dictionaly:"],"metadata":{"id":"EYtBNTmgcq-T"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9KKC_02YciSC"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Save the model state\n","model_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/study_DeepLearning/data/train_val_test_in_pytorch_model.pth'\n","torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This code will save the model's weights to a file named \"train_val_test_in_pytorch_model.pth\""],"metadata":{"id":"3-5A3crucupm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Loading the Model\n","To load the model for future predictions, you first need to recreate the model structure and then load the state dictionary into this structure.
