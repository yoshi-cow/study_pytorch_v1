To perform the operation you're describing using PyTorch, you can make use of broadcasting to multiply tensor `A` by tensor `B` along the specified dimensions. Broadcasting in PyTorch automatically expands the smaller tensor across the larger tensor's dimensions without copying data.\n","\n","In your case, tensor `A` has a shape of `[64, 50, 4]` and tensor `B` has a shape of `[64, 4]`. You want to multiply each `[50, 4]` slice of `A` with the corresponding `[4]` vector in `B` across the batch dimension, resulting in an output tensor of shape `[64, 50, 4]`.\n","\n","To achieve this, you need to reshape `B` so that it can be broadcasted correctly over `A`. Here's how you can do it:\n","\n","1. **Reshape `B`**: You need to add an extra dimension to `B` so that its shape becomes `[64, 1, 4]`. This can be done using `unsqueeze()`.\n","\n","2. **Multiply `A` and `B`**: Once `B` is reshaped, you can simply multiply `A` and `B`. Due to broadcasting, `B` will automatically expand to match the dimensions of `A`.\n","\n","Here is the PyTorch code to perform these steps:\n","\n","```python\n","import torch\n","\n","# Assume A and B are defined as follows:\n","# A is of shape [64, 50, 4]\n","A = torch.randn(64, 50, 4)\n","\n","# B is of shape [64, 4]\n","B = torch.randn(64, 4)\n","\n","# Reshape B to [64, 1, 4] so it can be broadcasted to match the dimensions of A\n","B = B.unsqueeze(1)\n","\n","# Multiply A and B\n","result = A * B\n","\n","# Check the shape of the resulting tensor\n","print(result.shape)  # Should print torch.Size([64, 50, 4])\n","```\n","\n","This code will output a tensor of shape `[64, 50, 4]` where each `[50, 4]` matrix in `A` is element-wise multiplied by its corresponding `[4]` vector in `B` across all 64 batches. This utilizes the powerful feature of broadcasting in PyTorch, making your computation efficient and straightforward without explicit looping."],"metadata":{"id":"81CHVLW5Ewhx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# How to sum above result in each record"],"metadata":{"id":"nTG5yu_wQLGh"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Certainly! To sum up the results from the tensor multiplication you performed, where your tensor is now of size `[64, 50, 4]`, you'll first want to sum across the last dimension (which is the feature dimension). This will reduce the tensor from `[64, 50, 4]` to `[64, 50]`. After that, you'll want to flatten this tensor to create a one-dimensional tensor of size `[3200]`.\n","\n","Hereâ€™s how you can perform these operations in PyTorch:\n","\n","1. **Sum over the feature dimension**: Use the `sum()` function with the appropriate dimension specified (in this case, dimension 2, because Python uses 0-based indexing).\n","2. **Flatten the tensor**: Use the `view()` or `flatten()` method to reshape the tensor from `[64, 50]` to `[3200]`.\n","\n","Here is the PyTorch code for these steps:\n","\n","```python\n","import torch\n","\n","# Assuming result is your [64, 50, 4] tensor from the previous operation\n","# Sum across the last dimension (features) to change the shape to [64, 50]\n","summed = result.sum(dim=2)\n","\n","# Now, flatten the tensor to get a shape of [3200]\n","flattened = summed.flatten()\n","\n","# Alternatively, you can combine the sum and flatten in a single line\n","# flattened = result.sum(dim=2).flatten()\n","\n","# Check the shape of the flattened tensor\n","print(flattened.shape)  # Should print torch.Size([3200])\n","```\n","\n","This approach first reduces the tensor's size by summing over the features, and then flattens it into a one-dimensional tensor, effectively converting a batch of sequences into a single flat vector. This is particularly useful when you need to process or analyze the summed data as a single vector, perhaps for further statistical analysis or as input to another neural network layer."],"metadata":{"id":"n8PlguQvQQeH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"5X1crQaBEsD3"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"7ZK9yDTTEt4k"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
