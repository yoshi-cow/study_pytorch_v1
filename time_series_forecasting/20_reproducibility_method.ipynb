To achieve this, you should control all sources of randomness in your code. Here are the key steps to set up a reproducible environment in PyTorch:\n","\n","1. **Set Seed for Random Number Generators**: This ensures that all random operations, such as weight initialization and data shuffling, are consistent.\n","\n","2. **Configure PyTorch’s Backend**: PyTorch uses different backends for CPU and GPU operations. You should ensure that these are configured to behave deterministically, especially when using GPUs.\n","\n","3. **Control External Libraries**: If your code depends on external libraries that use randomness, such as NumPy, you need to seed them as well.\n","\n","Here’s how you can configure these settings in your PyTorch code:\n","\n","```python\n","import torch\n","import numpy as np\n","import random\n","\n","# Seed setting function for reproducibility\n","def seed_torch(seed=1029):\n","    random.seed(seed)\n","    np.random.seed(seed)\n","    torch.manual_seed(seed)\n","    torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)\n","    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)  # if you are using multi-GPU.\n","    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True  # forces deterministic algorithms\n","    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False  # if benchmark=True, deterministic might not be guaranteed\n","\n","# Set the seed\n","seed_torch()\n","\n","# Example: model training or inference\n","```\n","\n","### Explanation:\n","- **Random and NumPy**: These are seeded to ensure that any operation using random numbers outside of PyTorch will be reproducible.\n","- **`torch.manual_seed()`**: Sets the seed for generating random numbers.\n","- **`torch.cuda.manual_seed()` and `torch.cuda.manual_seed_all()`**: Ensures reproducibility across GPU operations if you're using CUDA.\n","- **`torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic`**: Forces cuDNN to use only deterministic convolution algorithms.\n","- **`torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark`**: Should be set to `False` when you want reproducibility, as enabling it allows cuDNN to optimize convolutions algorithms which might not be deterministic.\n","\n","Keep in mind, while setting for reproducibility, there might be a potential trade-off in the performance due to the use of deterministic algorithms, which can be slower than non-deterministic ones.
