It's strategy to modify the learning rate in a predefined manner or in response to certain metrics such as the validation loss not improving, or simply as the training progresses. This can help in fine-tuning the training process, potentially leading to faster convergence or better final performance by overcoming hurdles like getting stuch in local minima or dealing with teh vanishing/exploding gradient problem.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cvKDKV3ofBA2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Types of Learning Rate Schedulers\n","PyTorch provides several built-in schedulers through its **torch.optim.lr_scheduler** module, including:\n","\n","* **StepLR**: Decays the learning rate of each parameter group by a factor of **gamma** every **step_size** spochs.\n","* **MultiStepLR**: Allows decaying the learning rate at specific epochs.\n","* **ExponentialLR**: Decays the learning rate of each parameter group by a factor of **gamma** every epoch.\n","* **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces learning rate when a metric has stopped improving, which is particularly useful when you're monitoring validation loss.\n","* **CosineAnnealingLR**: Adjusts the learning
