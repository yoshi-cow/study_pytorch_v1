This function can transform a model into a more optimized form that's better suited for the chosen execution environment. In your code snippet, the backend specified is **aot_eager**, which means the model is optimized but still runs in an eager execution mode, maintaining fexibility."],"metadata":{"id":"pixFRqlfb3WQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Merits of Using `torch.compile()`\n","1. **Performance Improvement**: By compilling the model ahead of time, you can reduce the runtime overhead associated with dynamic computational graph construction and optimization. This leads to faster inference.\n","2. **Optimized Execution**: Depending on the backend, **torch.compile()** can leverage specific hardware accelerations and optimizations, potentially enhancing the performance on specific devices.\n","3. **Reducing Latency**: For applications requiring low latency, like real-time systems, having a compiled model can significantly reduce response times."],"metadata":{"id":"jAAiGYeMcaKJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Demerits of Using `torch.compile()`\n","1. **Complexity in Setup**: The setup process for using **torch.compile()** can be more complex compared to simply using a model in its standard form.
