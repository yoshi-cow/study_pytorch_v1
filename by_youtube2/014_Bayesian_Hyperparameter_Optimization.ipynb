To represent this complex neuron structure as a vector, we use several numbers to descirbe this structure.\n","* **dropout** - The dropout percent for each layer.\n","* **neuronPct** - What percent of our fixed 5,000 maximum number of neurons do we wish to use? This parameter specifies the total count of neurons in the entire network.\n","* **nuronShrink** - Neural networks usually start with more neurons on the first hidden layer and then decrease this count for additional layers.
