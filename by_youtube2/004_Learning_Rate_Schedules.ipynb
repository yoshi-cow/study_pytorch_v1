They're designed to decrease the learning rate as the training progresses, allowing the network to make large adjustments in the initial stages of training, when the weights are likely far from their optimal values, and then make smaller adjustments as the training progresses, to fine-tune the weights. This adjustment helps mitigate the risk of overshooting the minimum point of the loss function and helps to reach convergence more smoothly.\n","\n","\n","\n","In PyTorch, one of the learning rate scheduling tools is the **StepLR** class, found in the **torch.optim.lr_scheduler** module. **StepLR** is a type of learning rate schedule that decreases the learining rate by a certain factor every few epochs. This allows the learning rate to decrease in a step-wise fashion rather than continuoulsy, which can be beneficial in some cases, as it gives the model time to 'settle' into areas of the loss landscape before the learning rate is reduced further.\n","\n","\n","StepLR takes three parameters:\n","* **optimizer**: The optimizer you're using to train your model (e.g., SGD, Adam)\n","* **step_size**: This is the number of epochs after which you want to reduce the learining rate. For instance, if step_size=10, then the learning rate will be reduced every 10 epochs.\n","* **gamma**: This is the factor by which the learning rate will be reduced at each step. For instance, if gamma=0.1, the learning rate will be multiplied by 0.1 at each step. effectively reducing it by 90%.\n","\n","\n","\n","The **StepLR** scheduler is used during the training loop. After each step of the optimizer (after **optimizer.step()**), you call **scheduler.step()** to adjust the learning rate according to the schedule.\n","\n","\n","\n","It's worth noting that the choice of **step_size** and gamma can be important, and may need to be tuned based on your specific problem and dataset. <u>Too large a **step_size** and the learning may not reduce quickly enough</u>; <u>too small and it may reduce too quickly</u>. Similarly, a gamma <u>too close 1 may not reduce the learning rate significantly enough, while a gamma too small may reduce it too quickly</u>.\n","\n","\n","\n","We now apply a learning rate to the k-fold cross validation example from the previous section."],"metadata":{"id":"UJjLcTxhyiWO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.stats import zscore\n","from
