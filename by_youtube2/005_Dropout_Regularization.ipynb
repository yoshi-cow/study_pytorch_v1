Regularization techniques are thus critical to ensure our model doesn't suffer from this common pitfall, striking a balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting). Regularization methods work by adding a penalty on the complexity of the model, effectively preventing the model from learning too much noise from the training data and thus enhancing its ability to generalize.\n","\n","\n","One such powerful regularization technique is **Dropout**, a concept that metaphorically **drops out** or temporarily **turns off** a fraction of neurons in the model during training, thereby reducing the interdependencies of neurons. The randomness introduced by dropping out neurons comels the network to learn more robust features, leading to a more generalized and less overfit model.\n","\n","\n","Dropout operates differently from most other regularization techniques. Instead of adding a penalty to the loss function, it randomly disables a fraction of neurons (defined by a probability parameter, typically ranging from 0.2 to 0.5), effectively creating a different architecture of the network for each training instance. This can be seen as training an ensemble of networks, which results in a more robust and generalizable final model.\n","\n","\n","In this section, we will delve into the nuances of dropout, explore its theoretical underpinnings, and illustrate how to apply it using various deep learning frameworks. Understanding and correctly implementing dropout is a valuable tool in the deep learning practitioner's toolkit, aiding the creation of robust and generalized models.\n","\n","\n","As we go through the chapter, you will understand how dropout fits perfectly into the grand schema of regularization methods, learn about its benefits and limitations, and grasp how to effectively use dropout in your deep learning models.\n","\n","\n","Dropout is a regularization technique that was introduced by Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the field of deep learining, and his students Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey Hiton, Alex Krizhevsky, IIya Sutskever, and Ruslan Slakhutdinov in a paper titled \"Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting\", which was published in 2014.\n","\n","\n","\n","The development of dropout came from the recognition of the challenges with overfitting in large neural networks. Large neural networks with millions of parameters are prone to overfitting because of their capacity to memorize training data. This is especially true when the amount of training data available is small relative to the complexity of the network.\n","\n","\n","Geoffrey Hinton, who is often referred to as the \"godfather of deep learning\", has made several seminal contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, with dropout being just one of them. He and his team were looking for simple and effective ways to make neural networks more robust and to improve their generalization capabilities. Inspired by biological systems, they proposed the idea of dropout, which involves randomly \"dropping out\" or deactivating a subset of neurons during the training process to prevent them from co-adapting too much to the data.\n","\n","\n","This simple yet effective techniques has since been widely adopted in the deep learning community and has formed the basis of numerous subsequent research and developments. Dropout has proven to be a powerful tool in the training of neural networks, helping to mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.\n","\n","\n","We will begin by modifying the previous example to use dropout. We will preprocess the data in the same way as before."],"metadata":{"id":"AQ1Z2UdROW3q"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.stats import zscore\n","from
